# Squeaky-Wheel    
Automatically run speed tests and tweet @ your ISP if they are garbage.  
### Overview:  
Python Script that utilizes selenium web driver to scrape speed test results and  
tweet them at your ISP if they are below a given value.  
###### This scripts compiles and logs:  
* Download Speed in Mbps  
* Upload Speed in Mbps  
* Latency in msec  
* Jitter in msec  

#### [MLab (Measurement Lab)](http://www.measurementlab.net/) is used for the speedtest.  
##### It's the same test that Google is using in its new native speedtest feature:  

![Google Test](https://s24.postimg.org/vdhuc51p1/image.png)  

The MLab's test is located @ http://www.measurementlab.net/tools/ndt/ ,  
but the data is scraped from http://www.measurementlab.net/p/ndt-ws.html  
because the test is served up through an iframe.  

The [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) Library is used to access the twitter API.  
You will need your own API keys and access tokens from https://dev.twitter.com/.   

#### Sample Output:

### Setup:  
##### Dependencies:  
`Selenium`  
`geckodriver`  
`Tweepy`  

##### Config:  
Config options can be set in **config.json**:  

###### Bandwidth  
Set "download" to the download speed you are supposed to get (in Mbps).  
Set "upload" to the upload speed you are supposed to get (in Mbps).  
###### Twitter
Put in your Twitter API keys and Access tokens in the "twitter" section.  
###### Margin  
The margin sets how much leeway there is for normal fluxuation.  
Example: a margin of ".5" triggers an exception and tweet if speeds dip  
below 50% of promised speeds (".6" == 60%, etc).  
**Must be between 0 and 1**.
